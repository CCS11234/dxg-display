My codes started from Linux udlfb module, many thanks to displaylink team, pls reference http://how-to.cc/get-a-displaylink-video-adapter-working-with-ubuntu-12-04 to start your journal of dxg display.

Notes
- Ubuntu 12.04 is the only verified platform now
- A little bit change of udlfb is required

Displaylink's Linux udlfb module is used in PC side, so it is clear that we need to write a usb gadget driver for dxg.
